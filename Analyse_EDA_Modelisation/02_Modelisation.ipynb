logistique, l'AUC score avait été estimé ≈ 0.72 avec rééquilibrage (SMOTE) des données. La suite de l'étude a été déroulée vers 3 algorithmes plus complexes de gradient boosting implémentés par LightGbm vs CatBoost vs XGBoost. Nous avons pu démontrer les performances de ces algorithmes par une sélection de features, à l'origine > 300, après RFECV 149. LightGbm ressort comme étant le plus rapide, le plus performant sur la métrique classique de l'AUC, il a donc été choisi pour l'optimisation des Hyperparamètres (Hyperopt).\n","\n","La fonction coût permet de pénaliser les erreurs de prédiction qui peuvent coûter cher à l'entreprise. En effet, avec l'implémentation de la métrique métier les FP sont estimés à 0.19% (contre 0.21%), les FN sont à 0.78% (contre 0.77%). Au final la métrique métier permet de pénaliser légèrement mieux les erreurs du modèle."]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"V100","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
